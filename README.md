Scenarios for Flashy Bub in learning Anatomy and Phisiology

Bub is taking Anatomy and Physiology as a Senior at the University of Puget Sound. The course itself entails learning all about the systems in the human body. Thus the course requires a large amount of memorization. Next Wednesday Bub has the Final for the course. The midterm exam did not go well for Bub, and Bub is planning on spending the Reading Period, the two days before the week of finals, to memorize all of the systems in the human body. For this memorization Bub reached out to her Professor, Professor Rochards, to ask for ideas on how to study most effectively for the final. Professor Rochards suggested taking the lecture slides and using flashy to cover up the labels on each of the systems of the body. Bub had heard of Quizlet before but was frustrated when she couldn't upload photos, but she had never heard of flashy. Bub began working on uploading lecture slides to flashy and after her first day of studying, she learned all the features of the bones, including the olecranon fossa. After the second day of Reading Period, Bub learned all the pathways for the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. On Wednesday, the day of the final, Bub felt so confident going into the exam. Professor Rochards was immensely impressed while grading Bubs Exam. Bub got 100% on her final all thanks to Flashy.
